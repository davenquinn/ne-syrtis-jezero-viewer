- Jezero crater - future landing site.
- Jezero itself is a much smaller feature, but it is part of one of the most exciting regions of Mars.


- I began working with 3D mapping to support making structural inferences
  for my Mars work.
- This is a trial of the 3D components we are working on at Macrostrat
- Incorporates new technical advances such as Terrain RGB tilesets

I began working with 3D visualizations of Mars data during my PhD.

At the Macrostrat lab, we are interested in enabling visualization of
geoscience data at world scale.

Since joining Macrostrat, I have taken many of the viz techniques I pioneered
at facilities such as the Murray Lab and am generalizing them to the more stable
and accessible web platform. This is the first public product of this line of research.

Guiding principles:

- Open standards


- Pushing industry-standard software tools to fulfill the needs of the geoscience
research community.

On this viewer, a set of work is needed:

- Make Javascript renderer more performant
- Improve generation of terrain and imagery tiles to remove artifacts

Sharing components with similar projects, such as TerriaJS, JPL's Mars Trek and


This type of work demands a sophisticated and automated data pipeline. Projects like

The global CTX mosaic.

But in general, this project, and the universe of similar visualizations and tools
that could follow.
