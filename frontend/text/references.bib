 abstract = {Valley networks, concentrations of dendritic channels that often suggest widespread pluvial and fluvial activity, have been cited as indicators that the climate of Mars differed significantly in the past from the present hyperarid cold desert conditions. Some researchers suggest that the change in climate was abrupt, while others favor a much more gradual transition. Thus, the precise timing of valley network formation is critical to understanding the climate history on Mars. We examine thirty valley network-incised regions on Mars, including both cratered upland valley networks and those outside the uplands, and apply a buffered crater counting technique to directly constrain when valley network formation occurred. The crater populations that we derive using this approach allow assessment of the timing of the last activity in a valley network independent of the mapping of specific geological units. From these measurements we find that valley networks cluster into two subdivisions in terms characteristics and age: (1) valley network activity in the cratered highlands has an average cessation age at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary and all valleys that we crater counted are Early Hesperian or older. No evidence is found for valley networks in the cratered uplands of Late Hesperian or Amazonian age. The timing of the cessation of cratered upland valley network activity at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary also corresponds to a decline in the intensity of large crater formation and degradation and to the apparent end of phyllosilicate-type weathering. (2) A few valley network-incised regions formed outside of the cratered uplands on volcanic edifices, in association with younger impact craters, and on the rim of Valles Marineris. We applied our buffered crater counting technique to four such valleys, on the volcanoes Ceraunius Tholus, Hecates Tholus, and Alba Patera and on the rim of Echus Chasma, and find that each has distinctive and different Late Hesperian or Early Amazonian ages, indicating that valley networks formed from time to time in the post-Noachian period. Unlike the cratered upland valley networks, these isolated occurrences are very local and have been interpreted to represent local conditions (e.g., snowpack melted during periods of intrusive volcanic activity). In contrast to a gradual cessation in the formation of valley networks proposed by some workers, our new buffered crater counting results indicate a relatively abrupt cessation in the formation of the widespread cratered upland valley networks at approximately the end of the Noachian, followed only by episodic and very localized valley network formation in later Mars history, very likely due to specific conditions (e.g., local magmatic heating). These valley network ages and correlations are thus consistent with a major change in the near-surface aqueous environment on Mars at approximately the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. The Noachian environment supported surface running water and fluvial erosion across Mars in the cratered uplands, enhanced crater degradation, and a weathering environment favoring the formation of phyllosilicates. The Hesperian-Amazonian environment was more similar to the hyperarid cold desert of today, with valley networks forming only extremely rarely and confined to localized special conditions. Sources of water for these latter occurrences are likely to be related to periodic mobilization and equatorward migration of polar volatiles due to variations in spin-axis orbital parameters, and to periodic catastrophic emergence of groundwater. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Gaidos2003,
 abstract = {We consider the hypothesis that Mars never experienced an early warm, wet period and the implications of a continuously cold Martian climate for the hydrology and geochemistry of the planet. Geomorphic evidence previously interpreted to indicate a more temperate early climate can be explained by cold climate processes and the transient flow of liquid water at the surface rather than a terrestrial-like hydrological cycle. In this scenario, freezing and confinement of crustal aquifers lead to the eruption of water or brines to the surface: Hesperian events formed massive ice sheets, and triggered floods that carved the outflow channels, while smaller, present-day aqueous eruptions are responsible for the seepage and gully-like landforms identified in high-resolution imaging. This process may have fluxed a significant volume of groundwater to the surface and the polar caps. A primordial source of groundwater reconciles the present D/H isotopic ratio of the atmosphere with fractionating atmospheric escape and a primordial Martian D/H inferred from hydrous phases of SNC meteorites. A cold early climate and a thin CO2 atmosphere are consistent with the ubiquity of primary igneous minerals and the apparent absence of secondary minerals and copious carbonates on the surface. Aqueous eruptions introduced soluble chloride and sulfate salts into Martian soils, leaving clays and carbonates within the crust. If the Martian crust hosts a deep biosphere, aqueous eruptions can bring organisms or their chemical signature to the surface. The biotic component of any recent eruptions may be preserved in transient ice in cold traps on the surface.},

 abstract = {Roughly 16,000, {$\sim$}20\textendash 50 m wide, morphologically diverse, erosionally resistant ridges have been exhumed and mapped in Noachian-aged terrain across a large region in Nili Fossae and the Nilosyrtis Highlands. However, the formation of these landforms has been widely debated. Their morphology and geologic context suggest surface processes such as aeolian, fluvial, and glacial sedimentary deposition are unlikely candidates for their formation. Possible subsurface ridge formation mechanisms include: 1) volcanic dike intrusions along pre-existing fractures, 2) breccia dikes from impact cratering, 3) clastic dikes or deformation bands, and 4) chemical alteration or precipitation of minerals in or along pre-existing fractures or faults. The ridges are being exhumed from a phyllosilicate-bearing host rock, but whether the ridges themselves have an aqueous origin remains unknown. Although, previous studies used comparative morphology to assess their formation, each hypothesized formation mechanism implies different mineralogical suites possibly detectable in remotely sensed spectral data.},

In this article, we demonstrate the sequences of lake filling and delta formation and constrain the minimum life span of the Jezero paleo-lake from sedimentological and hydrological analyses. Two main phases of delta evolution can be recognized by utilizing imagery provided by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) and High Resolution Stereo Camera (ESA Mars Express): (1) basin infilling before the breaching of the Jezero rim and (2) the delta formation itself. Our results suggest that delta formation occurred over a minimum period of 90\textendash 550 years of hydrological activity. Breaching of the Jezero rim occurred in at least three distinct episodes, which spanned a far longer time-period than overall delta formation. This evolutionary history implies that the Jezero-lake floor would have been a haven for fine-grained sediment accumulation and hosted an active environment of significant astrobiological importance.

@article{Scheller2020,
 abstract = {The western part of the Isidis basin structure hosts a well-characterized Early Noachian to Amazonian stratigraphy. The Noachian Basement comprises its oldest exposed rocks (Early to Mid-Noachian) and was previously considered a single low-Ca pyroxenes (LCP)- and Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing unit. Here, we divide the Noachian Basement Group into five distinct geological units (Stratified Basement Unit, Blue Fractured Unit, Mixed Lithology Plains Unit, LCP-bearing Plateaus Unit, and Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing Mounds Unit), two geomorphological features (megabreccia and ridges), and a mineral deposit (kaolinite-bearing bright materials), based on geomorphology, spectral characteristics, and stratigraphic relationships. Megabreccia contain four different pre-Isidis lithologies, possibly including deeper crust or mantle materials, formed through mass wasting associated with transient crater collapse during Isidis basin formation. The Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing Stratified Basement Unit and LCP-bearing Blue Fractured Unit likewise represent pre-Isidis units within the Noachian Basement Group. Multiple Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing geological units with different stratigraphic positions and younger kaolinite-bearing bright materials indicate several aqueous alteration episodes of different ages and styles. Units with slight changes in pyroxene spectral properties suggest a transition from low-Ca pyroxene-containing materials to those with higher proportions of pyroxenes higher in Ca and/or glass that could be related to different impact and/or igneous processes, or provenance. This long history of Noachian and potentially Pre-Noachian geological processes, including impact basin formation, aqueous alteration, and multiple igneous and sedimentary petrogeneses, records changing ancient Mars environmental conditions. All units defined by this study are available 20 km outside of Jezero crater for in situ analysis and sampling during a potential extended mission scenario for the Mars 2020 rover. Plain Language Summary The Isidis basin's Noachian Basement Group is a collection of geological materials that are among the oldest rocks exposed on the Martian surface ({$>$}3.8 billion years old). We have characterized their spectral signatures and appearances using instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Noachian Basement Group contains eight different geological categories of rocks formed at different times and by different processes. One of these categories is megabreccia, which are blocks of rocks created when a meteorite impact formed the 1,900-km Isidis impact basin. The megabreccia contain materials from deep within Mars and likely formed during enormous landslides after the impact.},

@article{Siebach2017,
 abstract = {Sedimentary rocks are composed of detrital grains derived from source rocks, which are altered by chemical weathering, sorted during transport, and cemented during diagenesis. Fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary rocks of the Bradbury group, observed on the floor of Gale crater by the Curiosity rover during its first 860 Martian solar days, show trends in bulk chemistry that are consistent with sorting of mineral grains during transport. The Bradbury group rocks are uniquely suited for sedimentary provenance analysis because they appear to have experienced negligible cation loss (i.e., open-system chemical weathering) at the scale of the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer bulk chemistry analyses based on low Chemical Index of Alteration values and successful modeling of {$>$}90\% of the (volatile-free) targets as mixtures of primary igneous minerals. Significant compositional variability between targets is instead correlated to grain-size and textural characteristics of the rocks; the coarsest-grained targets are enriched in Al2O3, SiO2, and Na2O, whereas the finer-grained targets are enriched in mafic components. This is consistent with geochemical and mineralogical modeling of the segregation of coarse-grained plagioclase from finer-grained mafic minerals (e.g., olivine and pyroxenes), which would be expected from hydrodynamic sorting of the detritus from mechanical breakdown of subalkaline plagioclase-phyric basalts. While the presence of a distinctive K2O-rich stratigraphic interval shows that input from at least one distinctive alkali-feldspar-rich protolith contributed to basin fill, the dominant compositional trends in the Bradbury group are consistent with sorting of detrital minerals during transport from relatively homogeneous plagioclase-phyric basalts.},

 abstract = {We use a 3D general circulation model to compare the primitive Martian hydrological cycle in "warm and wet" and "cold and icy" scenarios. In the warm and wet scenario, an anomalously high solar flux or intense greenhouse warming artificially added to the climate model are required to maintain warm conditions and an ice-free northern ocean. Precipitation shows strong surface variations, with high rates around Hellas basin and west of Tharsis but low rates around Margaritifer Sinus (where the observed valley network drainage density is nonetheless high). In the cold and icy scenario, snow migration is a function of both obliquity and surface pressure, and limited episodic melting is possible through combinations of seasonal, volcanic and impact forcing. At surface pressures above those required to avoid atmospheric collapse {\~(}0.5 bar) and moderate to high obliquity, snow is transported to the equatorial highland regions where the concentration of valley networks is highest. Snow accumulation in the Aeolis quadrangle is high, indicating an ice-free northern ocean is not required to supply water to Gale crater. At lower surface pressures and obliquities, both H2O and CO2 are trapped as ice at the poles and the equatorial regions become extremely dry. The valley network distribution is positively correlated with snow accumulation produced by the cold and icy simulation at 41.8 degrees obliquity but uncorrelated with precipitation produced by the warm and wet simulation. Because our simulations make specific predictions for precipitation patterns under different climate scenarios, they motivate future targeted geological studies.},
