 abstract = {As inferred from orbital spectroscopic data, Northeast Syrtis Major bears considerable mineral diversity that spans the Noachian-Hesperian boundary despite its small geographic area. In this study we use observations from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, supplemented with Context Camera imagery, to characterize and map the lateral extent of geomorphic units in Northeast Syrtis Major, and constrain the geomorphic context of the orbital-identified mineral signatures. Using recent observations, we confirm previous mineralogy identified with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, and greatly extend the lateral extent of visible to near-infrared investigation utilizing the greater coverage. Analysis of Thermal Emission Imaging System observations reveals further physical properties and distribution of the geomorphic units. The stratigraphy, which spans the Noachian-Hesperian boundary, displays significant morphological heterogeneity at the decameter scale, but it is unifiable under five distinct geomorphic units. Our paired morphological and mineralogical analysis allows us to construct a detailed geological history of Northeast Syrtis Major. Several geological events that occurred in Northeast Syrtis Major\textemdash including the formation of the post-Isidis crust, the emplacement of an olivine-rich unit, the formation of sulfate minerals, and the emplacement of the Syrtis Major Volcanics\textemdash can be related to regional and global processes constraining the local chronology. Other mineralogical indicators, particularly the formation of Al-phyllosilicates, are difficult to place in the temporal sequence. They are observed in isolated patches on the post-Isidis crust, not as a distinct stratigraphic unit as observed elsewhere in Nili Fossae, suggesting their formation via isolated leaching or through alteration of initial compositional heterogeneities within the crust. Exposures of an olivine-rich unit are intermittently observed to form quasi-circular landforms, suggestive of emplacement in circular depressions, which may indicate a period of cratering between the formation of the Isidis basin and the deposition of the olivine-rich unit. We identify and discuss intriguing large linear features of the olivine-rich unit, reminiscent of dyke-fed volcanism, that have raised bounding ridges suggestive of contact metamorphism with the crust. We compile, review, and discuss many of the outstanding questions and running hypotheses relevant to our mapping area. A synthesis of our geomorphic mapping with recent literature reveals a well-defined geological history with extensive aqueous activity at Northeast Syrtis Major that is amassed in a stratigraphic sequence spanning a time likely greater than 250 million years of geological history. Our geomorphic and spectral analyses confirm that Northeast Syrtis Major exhibits considerable geomorphic and mineralogic diversity within a relatively small geographic area that is representative of the geologic processes occurring throughout the broader Nili Fossae region during the Noachian and Hesperian. Northeast Syrtis Major adds to this sequence by exposing the diverse environmental history of this region as observed through the presence of alteration minerals not present in this fidelity or proximity elsewhere in Nili Fossae.},

 abstract = {Lakes and lake deposits present two fundamental paradoxes: (1) Modern lakes are vastly complicated, but the rock records of lakes are relatively simple; extensive observations reveal three distinct facies associations of common and widespread occurrence. These are referred to here as fluvial-lacustrine, fluctuating profundal, and evaporative facies associations. (2) Most explanations of modern and ancient lakes attribute their nature to climate, but neither modern lake parameters (lake size, depth, and salinity) nor the character of ancient-lake strata (thickness, extent, lithology) correlate with measured or inferred climatic humidity. We propose that it is the relative balance of rates of potential accommodation (mostly tectonic) with sediment + water fill (mostly a function of climate) that controls lake occurrence, distribution, and character. Lake basins may be termed overfilled, balanced fill, or underfilled, depending on the balance between these rates. We conclude that climate and tectonics exert coequal influence on lake deposits at both mesoscales (1 m to hundreds of meters) and macroscales (hundreds to thousands of meters).},

 abstract = {Polygonal fault systems (PFS) are widely developed along many continental margin basins and some interior cratonic and foreland basins. They are networks of small normal faults that are usually found in tiers which are crudely layer-bound successions consisting mainly of fine-grained sediments. Their origin has been widely debated with explanations ranging from dewatering of overpressured layers to gravitational loading under fixed lateral boundary conditions. Their distribution in fine-grained intervals suggests that their genesis is connected to their initial lithology. Recent experimental work suggests that diagenesis of clay-rich sediments can lead to shear failure under low confining stresses. This explanation accords well with all subsurface observations of PFS made to date, and seems the most likely mechanism to explain their genesis. This diagenetic mode of shear fracturing in fine-grained sediments could be much more prevalent than in polygonal fault systems alone, and this has significant implications for shale gas exploration, CO2 sequestration and exploration for methane hydrates. \textcopyright{} 2011.},

 abstract = {The Noachian terrain west of the Isidis basin hosts a diverse collection of alteration minerals in rocks comprising varied geomorphic units within a 100,000 km2 region in and near the Nili Fossae. Prior investigations in this region by the Observatoire pour l'Min\'eralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces, et l'Activit\'e (OMEGA) instrument on Mars Express revealed large exposures of both mafic minerals and iron magnesium phyllosilicates in stratigraphic context. Expanding on the discoveries of OMEGA, the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has found more spatially widespread and mineralogically diverse alteration minerals than previously realized, which represent multiple aqueous environments. Using CRISM near-infrared spectral data, we detail the basis for identification of iron and magnesium smectites (including both nontronite and more Mg-rich varieties), chlorite, prehnite, serpentine, kaolinite, potassium mica (illite or muscovite), hydrated (opaline) silica, the sodium zeolite analcime, and magnesium carbonate. The detection of serpentine and analcime on Mars is reported here for the first time. We detail the geomorphic context of these minerals using data from high-resolution imagers onboard MRO in conjunction with CRISM. We find that the distribution of alteration minerals is not homogeneous; rather, they occur in provinces with distinctive assemblages of alteration minerals. Key findings are (1) a distinctive stratigraphy, in and around the Nili Fossae, of kaolinite and magnesium carbonate in bedrock units always overlying Fe/Mg smectites and (2) evidence for mineral phases and assemblages indicative of low-grade metamorphic or hydrothermal aqueous alteration in cratered terrains. The alteration minerals around the Nili Fossae are more typical of those resulting from neutral to alkaline conditions rather than acidic conditions, which appear to have dominated much of Mars. Moreover, the mineralogic diversity and geologic context of alteration minerals found in the region around the Nili Fossae indicates several episodes of aqueous activity in multiple distinct environments.},

Analysis of how they formed should indicate what environmental conditions prevailed on early Mars. If clays formed near the surface by weathering, as is common on Earth, their presence would indicate past surface conditions warmer and wetter than at present. However, available data instead indicate substantial Martian clay formation by hydrothermal groundwater circulation and a Noachian rock record dominated by evidence of subsurface waters.

@article{Fassett2008,
 abstract = {Valley networks, concentrations of dendritic channels that often suggest widespread pluvial and fluvial activity, have been cited as indicators that the climate of Mars differed significantly in the past from the present hyperarid cold desert conditions. Some researchers suggest that the change in climate was abrupt, while others favor a much more gradual transition. Thus, the precise timing of valley network formation is critical to understanding the climate history on Mars. We examine thirty valley network-incised regions on Mars, including both cratered upland valley networks and those outside the uplands, and apply a buffered crater counting technique to directly constrain when valley network formation occurred. The crater populations that we derive using this approach allow assessment of the timing of the last activity in a valley network independent of the mapping of specific geological units. From these measurements we find that valley networks cluster into two subdivisions in terms characteristics and age: (1) valley network activity in the cratered highlands has an average cessation age at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary and all valleys that we crater counted are Early Hesperian or older. No evidence is found for valley networks in the cratered uplands of Late Hesperian or Amazonian age. The timing of the cessation of cratered upland valley network activity at the Noachian-Hesperian boundary also corresponds to a decline in the intensity of large crater formation and degradation and to the apparent end of phyllosilicate-type weathering. (2) A few valley network-incised regions formed outside of the cratered uplands on volcanic edifices, in association with younger impact craters, and on the rim of Valles Marineris. We applied our buffered crater counting technique to four such valleys, on the volcanoes Ceraunius Tholus, Hecates Tholus, and Alba Patera and on the rim of Echus Chasma, and find that each has distinctive and different Late Hesperian or Early Amazonian ages, indicating that valley networks formed from time to time in the post-Noachian period. Unlike the cratered upland valley networks, these isolated occurrences are very local and have been interpreted to represent local conditions (e.g., snowpack melted during periods of intrusive volcanic activity). In contrast to a gradual cessation in the formation of valley networks proposed by some workers, our new buffered crater counting results indicate a relatively abrupt cessation in the formation of the widespread cratered upland valley networks at approximately the end of the Noachian, followed only by episodic and very localized valley network formation in later Mars history, very likely due to specific conditions (e.g., local magmatic heating). These valley network ages and correlations are thus consistent with a major change in the near-surface aqueous environment on Mars at approximately the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. The Noachian environment supported surface running water and fluvial erosion across Mars in the cratered uplands, enhanced crater degradation, and a weathering environment favoring the formation of phyllosilicates. The Hesperian-Amazonian environment was more similar to the hyperarid cold desert of today, with valley networks forming only extremely rarely and confined to localized special conditions. Sources of water for these latter occurrences are likely to be related to periodic mobilization and equatorward migration of polar volatiles due to variations in spin-axis orbital parameters, and to periodic catastrophic emergence of groundwater. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {We consider the hypothesis that Mars never experienced an early warm, wet period and the implications of a continuously cold Martian climate for the hydrology and geochemistry of the planet. Geomorphic evidence previously interpreted to indicate a more temperate early climate can be explained by cold climate processes and the transient flow of liquid water at the surface rather than a terrestrial-like hydrological cycle. In this scenario, freezing and confinement of crustal aquifers lead to the eruption of water or brines to the surface: Hesperian events formed massive ice sheets, and triggered floods that carved the outflow channels, while smaller, present-day aqueous eruptions are responsible for the seepage and gully-like landforms identified in high-resolution imaging. This process may have fluxed a significant volume of groundwater to the surface and the polar caps. A primordial source of groundwater reconciles the present D/H isotopic ratio of the atmosphere with fractionating atmospheric escape and a primordial Martian D/H inferred from hydrous phases of SNC meteorites. A cold early climate and a thin CO2 atmosphere are consistent with the ubiquity of primary igneous minerals and the apparent absence of secondary minerals and copious carbonates on the surface. Aqueous eruptions introduced soluble chloride and sulfate salts into Martian soils, leaving clays and carbonates within the crust. If the Martian crust hosts a deep biosphere, aqueous eruptions can bring organisms or their chemical signature to the surface. The biotic component of any recent eruptions may be preserved in transient ice in cold traps on the surface.},

Enhancing the rate of such reactions is a proposed method for geologic CO2 storage, and perhaps for direct capture of CO2 from near-surface fluids. We review, synthesize, and extend inferences from a variety of sources. We include data from studies on natural peridotite carbonation processes, carbonation kinetics, feedback between permeability and volume change via reaction-driven cracking, and proposed methods for enhancing the rate of natural mineral carbonation via in situ processes (``at the outcrop'') rather than ex situ processes (``at the smokestack'').},

 abstract = {Serpentinization is a weathering process in which ultramafic rocks react with water, generating a range of products, including serpentine and other minerals, in addition to H2 and low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons that are capable of sustaining microbial life. Lipid biomarker analyses of serpentinite-hosted ecosystems hold promise as tools for investigating microbial activity in ancient Earth environments and other terrestrial planets such as Mars because lipids have the potential for longer term preservation relative to DNA, proteins, and other more labile organic molecules. Here, we report the first lipid biomarker record of microbial activity in the mantle section of the Samail Ophiolite, in the Sultanate of Oman, a site undergoing active serpentinization. We detected isoprenoidal (archaeal) and branched (bacterial) glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids, including those with 0\textendash 3 cyclopentane moieties, and crenarchaeol, an isoprenoidal GDGT containing four cyclopentane and one cyclohexane moieties, as well as monoether lipids and fatty acids indicative of sulfatereducing bacteria. Comparison of our geochemical data and 16S rRNA data from the Samail Ophiolite with those from other serpentinite-hosted sites identifies the existence of a common core serpentinization microbiome. In light of these findings, we also discuss the preservation potential of serpentinite lipid biomarker assemblages on Earth and Mars. Continuing investigations of the Samail Ophiolite and other terrestrial analogues will enhance our understanding of microbial habitability and diversity in serpentinite-hosted environments on Earth and elsewhere in the Solar System.

Possible subsurface ridge formation mechanisms include: 1) volcanic dike intrusions along pre-existing fractures, 2) breccia dikes from impact cratering, 3) clastic dikes or deformation bands, and 4) chemical alteration or precipitation of minerals in or along pre-existing fractures or faults. The ridges are being exhumed from a phyllosilicate-bearing host rock, but whether the ridges themselves have an aqueous origin remains unknown. Although, previous studies used comparative morphology to assess their formation, each hypothesized formation mechanism implies different mineralogical suites possibly detectable in remotely sensed spectral data.},

 abstract = {Ancient stratigraphy on Isidis Basin's western margin records the history of water on early Mars. Noachian units are overlain by layered, basaltic composition sedimentary rocks that are enriched in polyhydrated sulfates and capped by more resistant units. The layered sulfates\textemdash uniquely exposed at northeast Syrtis Major\textemdash comprise a sedimentary sequence up to 600 m thick that has undergone a multistage history of deposition, alteration, and erosion. Siliciclastic sediments enriched in polyhydrated sulfates are bedded at meter scale and were deposited on slopes up to 10\textdegree, embaying and thinning against preexisting Noachian highlands around the Isidis Basin rim. The layered sulfates were modified by volume loss fracturing during diagenesis. Resultant fractures hosted channelized flow and jarosite mineral precipitation to form resistant ridges upon erosion. The structural form of the layered sulfates is consistent with packages of sediment fallen from either atmospheric or aqueous suspension; coupling with substantial diagenetic volume loss may favor deepwater basin sedimentation. After formation, the layered sulfates were capped by a ``smooth capping unit'' and then eroded to form paleovalleys. Hesperian Syrtis Major lavas were channelized by this paleotopography, capping it in some places and filling it in others. Later fluvial features and phyllosilicate-bearing lacustrine deposits, sharing a regional base level of {$\sim-$}2,300 m, were superimposed on the sulfate-lava stratigraphy. The layered sulfates suggest surface bodies of water and active groundwater upwelling during the Noachian-Hesperian transition. The northeast Syrtis Major stratigraphy records at least four distinct phases of surface and subsurface aqueous activity spanning from late Noachian to early Amazonian time.},

In this article, we demonstrate the sequences of lake filling and delta formation and constrain the minimum life span of the Jezero paleo-lake from sedimentological and hydrological analyses. Two main phases of delta evolution can be recognized by utilizing imagery provided by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) and High Resolution Stereo Camera (ESA Mars Express): (1) basin infilling before the breaching of the Jezero rim and (2) the delta formation itself. Our results suggest that delta formation occurred over a minimum period of 90\textendash 550 years of hydrological activity. Breaching of the Jezero rim occurred in at least three distinct episodes, which spanned a far longer time-period than overall delta formation.

@article{Scheller2020,
 abstract = {The western part of the Isidis basin structure hosts a well-characterized Early Noachian to Amazonian stratigraphy. The Noachian Basement comprises its oldest exposed rocks (Early to Mid-Noachian) and was previously considered a single low-Ca pyroxenes (LCP)- and Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing unit. Here, we divide the Noachian Basement Group into five distinct geological units (Stratified Basement Unit, Blue Fractured Unit, Mixed Lithology Plains Unit, LCP-bearing Plateaus Unit, and Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing Mounds Unit), two geomorphological features (megabreccia and ridges), and a mineral deposit (kaolinite-bearing bright materials), based on geomorphology, spectral characteristics, and stratigraphic relationships. Megabreccia contain four different pre-Isidis lithologies, possibly including deeper crust or mantle materials, formed through mass wasting associated with transient crater collapse during Isidis basin formation. The Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing Stratified Basement Unit and LCP-bearing Blue Fractured Unit likewise represent pre-Isidis units within the Noachian Basement Group. Multiple Fe/Mg-smectite-bearing geological units with different stratigraphic positions and younger kaolinite-bearing bright materials indicate several aqueous alteration episodes of different ages and styles. Units with slight changes in pyroxene spectral properties suggest a transition from low-Ca pyroxene-containing materials to those with higher proportions of pyroxenes higher in Ca and/or glass that could be related to different impact and/or igneous processes, or provenance. This long history of Noachian and potentially Pre-Noachian geological processes, including impact basin formation, aqueous alteration, and multiple igneous and sedimentary petrogeneses, records changing ancient Mars environmental conditions. All units defined by this study are available 20 km outside of Jezero crater for in situ analysis and sampling during a potential extended mission scenario for the Mars 2020 rover. Plain Language Summary The Isidis basin's Noachian Basement Group is a collection of geological materials that are among the oldest rocks exposed on the Martian surface ({$>$}3.8 billion years old). We have characterized their spectral signatures and appearances using instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Noachian Basement Group contains eight different geological categories of rocks formed at different times and by different processes. One of these categories is megabreccia, which are blocks of rocks created when a meteorite impact formed the 1,900-km Isidis impact basin. The megabreccia contain materials from deep within Mars and likely formed during enormous landslides after the impact.},

@article{Siebach2017,
 abstract = {Sedimentary rocks are composed of detrital grains derived from source rocks, which are altered by chemical weathering, sorted during transport, and cemented during diagenesis. Fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary rocks of the Bradbury group, observed on the floor of Gale crater by the Curiosity rover during its first 860 Martian solar days, show trends in bulk chemistry that are consistent with sorting of mineral grains during transport. The Bradbury group rocks are uniquely suited for sedimentary provenance analysis because they appear to have experienced negligible cation loss (i.e., open-system chemical weathering) at the scale of the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer bulk chemistry analyses based on low Chemical Index of Alteration values and successful modeling of {$>$}90\% of the (volatile-free) targets as mixtures of primary igneous minerals. Significant compositional variability between targets is instead correlated to grain-size and textural characteristics of the rocks; the coarsest-grained targets are enriched in Al2O3, SiO2, and Na2O, whereas the finer-grained targets are enriched in mafic components. This is consistent with geochemical and mineralogical modeling of the segregation of coarse-grained plagioclase from finer-grained mafic minerals (e.g., olivine and pyroxenes), which would be expected from hydrodynamic sorting of the detritus from mechanical breakdown of subalkaline plagioclase-phyric basalts. While the presence of a distinctive K2O-rich stratigraphic interval shows that input from at least one distinctive alkali-feldspar-rich protolith contributed to basin fill, the dominant compositional trends in the Bradbury group are consistent with sorting of detrital minerals during transport from relatively homogeneous plagioclase-phyric basalts.},

@article{Soucek2015,
 abstract = {Isidis Planitia is a 1350 km wide impact crater located close to the martian equator. To test the hypothesis that the 2.8 to 3.4 Ga old Thumbprint Terrain preserved on the floor of this basin is a glacial landform assemblage, we perform a numerical simulation of glaciation with a thermo-mechanically coupled model of ice sheet dynamics. As model inputs, we use surface temperatures and ice accumulation patterns predicted by a General Circulation Model based on the present-day atmospheric characteristics, and values of the geothermal heat flux provided by a global model of planetary thermal evolution. We find that, under favorable orbital conditions, an ice sheet covering the entire basin can develop in 2 to 5 Ma, with a maximum thickness of 4.9 km. The modeled ice sheet is polythermal: it is permanently cold-based in the periphery and, due to a negative heat-flux anomaly, also in the center, while the pressure melting point is reached in an intermediate ring. Our simulation is consistent with the interpretation that the Thumbprint Terrain is a martian equivalent of terrestrial ribbed moraines and has formed below a wet-based ice sheet. It supports also the interpretation that sinuous ridges and linear valleys observed at the periphery of the basin are parts of a subglacial network of eskers and tunnel valleys that drained the glacial meltwater outwards, across the cold-based periphery of the ice sheet. This work strengthens the hypothesis that glaciers thick as much as several km may have existed on Mars several Ga ago and that glacial basal melting may have contributed to the production and flow of surface liquid water at that time, under an atmosphere no thicker than the present-day one.},

 abstract = {We use a 3D general circulation model to compare the primitive Martian hydrological cycle in "warm and wet" and "cold and icy" scenarios. In the warm and wet scenario, an anomalously high solar flux or intense greenhouse warming artificially added to the climate model are required to maintain warm conditions and an ice-free northern ocean. Precipitation shows strong surface variations, with high rates around Hellas basin and west of Tharsis but low rates around Margaritifer Sinus (where the observed valley network drainage density is nonetheless high). In the cold and icy scenario, snow migration is a function of both obliquity and surface pressure, and limited episodic melting is possible through combinations of seasonal, volcanic and impact forcing. At surface pressures above those required to avoid atmospheric collapse {\~(}0.5 bar) and moderate to high obliquity, snow is transported to the equatorial highland regions where the concentration of valley networks is highest. Snow accumulation in the Aeolis quadrangle is high, indicating an ice-free northern ocean is not required to supply water to Gale crater. At lower surface pressures and obliquities, both H2O and CO2 are trapped as ice at the poles and the equatorial regions become extremely dry. The valley network distribution is positively correlated with snow accumulation produced by the cold and icy simulation at 41.8 degrees obliquity but uncorrelated with precipitation produced by the warm and wet simulation. Because our simulations make specific predictions for precipitation patterns under different climate scenarios, they motivate future targeted geological studies.},
