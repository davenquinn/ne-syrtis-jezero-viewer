# Changelog

## `[0.6.0]` 2021-04-15

- Select a single geologic map layer for display
- Add [Kremer et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1130/G45563.1) mapping of olivine-rich layer
- Finish applying basic map colors for all maps
- Create structures to improve alignment of geologic maps
- Clicking the map now shows geological units at that location for all maps

## `[0.5.2]` 2021-02-20

- Add HiRISE mosaic of the landing site
- Greatly increase level of detail of topography for each tile

## `[0.5.1]` 2021-02-19

- The _Perseverance_ rover has landed successfully (ðŸŽ‰), and now you can see its
  position on the map!

### Known bugs

The alignment of the topography and the CTX global mosaic
are off in the Jezero delta region by ~30 m at least. We need to
re-align the datasets or bring in HiRISE orthophotos.

## `[0.5.0]` 2021-02-18

- Added vector tile layers for geologic maps!

### Known bugs

We're not currently able to control order of map layers effectively.

## `[0.4.0]` 2021-02-17

- Major update to the Cesium viewer underlying this interface to bring the
  code into alignment with Macrostrat's [in-development Earth viewer](https://dev.macrostrat.org/next/web)
- Updated terrain data processor to use web workers
- Fixed some unnecessary re-renders
- Brought in CTX and HiRISE elevation models of landing site and immediate context

## `[0.3.0]` 2021-02-12

- Added CRISM layer, with ability to toggle and enable from hash string
- Reorganize text a little bit
- Small style fixes

## `[0.2.1]` 2021-02-10

- Fix bug with base URL

## `[0.2.0]` 2021-02-10

#### Return to a position

Positions can now be retreived from URL hash parameters, enabling "deep linking" to specific locations. Parameters
represent the camera position, using the following schema:

- `x`: Latitude (degrees)
- `y`: Latitude (degrees)
- `z`: Elevation (meters relative to Mars 2000 datum)
- `a`: Azimuth (degrees from N)
- `e`: Off-nadir angle (degrees from vertical)

At least `x` and `y` must be defined for a position to be returned.

#### Deployment

- Decouple data backend from frontend viewer
- Add deployment scripts for Macrostrat server

## `[0.1.2]` 2021-02-09

- Add button to show and hide the sidebar
- Add links to GitHub revision and automate version string
- Small styling fixes

## `[0.1.1]` 2020-08-10

### Changes

- A few new references in main body text
- Added this Changelog as a separate page

### Bugs fixed

- Removed elevation artifacts caused by smoothing and off-by-one errors
- Small typographical and grammatical errors
- Rendering of hillshade layer in production
- Scroll container bounds on narrow mobile devices

## `[0.1.0]` 2020-08-03

- Initial release
