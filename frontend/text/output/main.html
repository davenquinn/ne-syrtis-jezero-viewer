<h3>Upper stratigraphy</h3>

<p>The upper stratigraphy of northeast Syrtis Major was emplaced between late Noachian and Amazonian time.

<h4>Thick, layered sediments</h4>
<div data-location="layered-sulfates">
<p>The “layered sulfates”, ~40 km southwest of Jezero Crater, are a sequence sedimentary rocks up to 450 m thick that sit unconformably above the eroded basement units. The sediments drape the underlying basement and are not flat-lying, suggesting deposition by settling rather than traction currents.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="side-note">
<p>Although these rocks are called the “layered sulfates” due to their spectral signatures discerned from orbit, they are unlikely to be sulfates in the traditional, evaporite sense. Instead, they are probably sulfate-cemented, clastic sedimentary rocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="side-note">
<p>Much of my PhD was devoted to studying the layered sulfates and their position within the upper stratigraphy of northeast Syrtis Major. <span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></span> reports many of the units and relationships described below. Many of these discoveries were largely informed by the basic physical relationships exhibited in this viewer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-location="smooth-capping-surface">
<p>The layered sulfates have been substantially eroded, and are preserved only in mesas capped by an erosionally resistant unit. In some places, the layered sulfates occur beneath the Syrtis Major lavas, but much of their preserved area is instead topped by an enigmatic “smooth capping unit.” This ~5-20 m thick cap is significantly smoother than the lava flows, occurs at higher elevation, and retains craters poorly.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> Its origin is currently unknown.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="boxwork-fractures-area">
<p>A particularly striking feature of the layered sulfates are “boxwork” ridges that cover large portions of the unit. These ridges show spectral signatures of jarosite, an iron sulfate mineral indicative of acidic waters (on Earth, it is usually associated with ore deposits). They were originally formed as fractures and later channelized sulfate-bearing fluids.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span></p>
<p>These ridges are often arcuate, have no preferred orientation, and penetrate the entire thickness of the layered sulfates where exposed. They are similar in geometry and scale to “polygonal faults” found in terrestrial submarine sediments; these form due to compaction and dewatering after deposition.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cartwright2011 Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>,<a href="#ref-Cartwright2011" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div data-location="sulfate-overview">
Together, the draping depositional style of the layered sulfates and the volume-loss fractures they host suggest that these sediments were deposited in a submarine setting. This is a fairly surprising finding, strongly suggesting the presence of a global ocean on Mars during Noachian time.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> Alternatively, a proposed ice sheet in Isidis Basin<span class="citation" data-cites="Soucek2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Soucek2015" role="doc-biblioref">27</a></sup></span> could conceivably provide periglacial lacustrine environments for deposition of thick sedimentary sequences.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<section id="a-multistage-history-of-subsurface-and-surface-water" class="level3">
<h3>A multistage history of subsurface and surface water</h3>
<div data-location="syrtis-overview-2">
<p>The northeast Syrtis Major stratigraphy records a phase of intense bedrock alteration in a vigorous subsurface water system. A thick sedimentary sequence above this was likely emplaced by underwater deposition followed by progressive erosion and capping by both lavas and thin, enigmatic capping units. The last substantial stage of erosion carved small channels and built deltas and shallow lake deposits within localized basins. These lake deposits are often close in elevation and similar form to the Jezero deposits, suggesting formation in the same system.</p>
<p>As the Perseverance mission progresses, it will be critical to situate the rover’s findings in this multiphase history of subsurface and surface hydrology. The breadth of the system also underscores the importance of the rover’s planned extended mission out of Jezero Crater and south towards the proposed “Midway” landing site. This will allow the rover to see many northeast Syrtis Major units <em>in situ</em>, which will provide an incredible wealth of information about the groundwater system of early Mars.</p>

<p><a href="/about">This viewer interface</a> is an adaptation of a digital globe renderer currently under construction for the <a href="https://macrostrat.org">Macrostrat</a> composite geologic map interface. Here, the code is adapted for Mars; most critically, it integrates topography data products (especially, a multistrip CTX elevation model) that extend medium-resolution elevation maps over a large area. These context-scale regional products are difficult to generate using current tooling, but are important basic precursors for any study emphasizing regional geologic context.</p>
<p>The potential for 3D visualization in the geosciences is evolving rapidly; the field can benefit from a growing ecosystem of impressive Earth observation software. The Mars science community must prioritize the generation of wide-area composite products that can unlock the potential of these new media and drive assessment of geologic context.</p>
