<p>This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the <strong>Perseverance</strong> rover, currently <em>en route</em> to Mars after launching on July 30th, 2020. Jezero sits within the northeast Syrtis region, an area with a rich and multifaceted geological history. If the Mars 2020 mission can reconstruct parts of this regional sequence from its small study area, it will provide major new information on the history and fate of water (and <em>perhaps</em> life) on Mars.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="jezero_w">
<p>Jezero is a ~40 km–diameter impact crater on the western margin of Isidis Basin. Perseverance will land just inside its western rim.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="jezero_delta">
<p>The centerpiece of Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited where a river entered a shallow lake filling the crater.<span class="citation" data-cites="Schon2012"><sup><a href="#ref-Schon2012" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> This impressive feature is the most charismatic surface expression of a long-lived regional drainage network. However, whether this and similar features are indicative of a global hydrosphere and “warm and wet” early Martian climate is hotly debated.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gaidos2003 Wordsworth2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Gaidos2003" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Wordsworth2015" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div data-location="full_of_sediment">
<p>In addition to hosting a delta, Jezero is filled to the brim with sediment, likely at least 1 km thick. Reasonable timescales of deposition rate suggest that filling the entire crater took upwards of 1–10 Myr.<span class="citation" data-cites="Goudge2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Goudge2015" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span> Crater-counting studies on the resistant crater floor unit suggest that this sedimentary fill was deposited before 3.5–3.8 Gyr ago.<span class="citation" data-cites="Fassett2008 Goudge2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Goudge2015" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-Fassett2008" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="side-note">
<p>The sediments filling Jezero Crater present an interesting parallel to Gale Crater, where the Curiosity rover has been operating since 2012. Gale hosts a similar (although much thicker) sedimentary sequence, much of which has been excavated by wind erosion. Here, it remains buried and inaccessible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-location="outlet_channel">
<p>Jezero also has an outlet channel, and apparent changes in its geometry over time suggest a long-lived lacustrine system.<span class="citation" data-cites="Salese2020a Schon2012"><sup><a href="#ref-Schon2012" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Salese2020a" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div data-location="jezero_delta_2">
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the Jezero fluvial system is the extent of its drainage system, which integrates sediment from a large area of the Martian highlands.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="river_nili_fossae">
<p>The river valley upstream of the Jezero delta continues eastward into the uplands surrounding Isidis Basin.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="river_nili_fossae_detail">
<p>It cuts across the Nili Fossae ring graben system, concentric valleys formed shortly after the Isidis Basin–forming impact.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="river_nilosyrtis">
<p>The upstream extension of the paleoriver that deposited sediment in Jezero Crater continues for over 200 km past the northern rim of Hargraves crater, and into the Nilosyrtis highlands. With careful geochemical analysis and deconvolution,<span class="citation" data-cites="Siebach2017"><sup><a href="#ref-Siebach2017" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> the sediments might provide a window into bedrock formation and alteration across a wide area.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="ne-syrtis-overview">
<p>Jezero crater sits in one of the most-studied and significant regional contexts on Mars. The stratigraphy of Northeast Syrtis contains rock units representing the first billion years of Mars history in close proximity.</p>
</div>
<p>The northeast Syrtis region is also fascinating.</p>
