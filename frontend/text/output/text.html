<p>This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the <strong>Perseverance</strong> rover, currently <em>en route</em> to Mars after launching on July 30th, 2020. Jezero sits within northeast Syrtis Major, a region with a rich and multifaceted geological history.</p>
<p>If the Mars 2020 mission can effectively use its direct observations of Jezero and its surroundings to answer questions posed by regional contextual studies, we will develop a much richer accounting of the history and fate of water (and <em>perhaps</em> life) on early Mars.</p>
<!-- Much of my PhD was dedicated to interpreting the geologic history of Syrtis Major,
particularly aspects involving the "layered sulfates" exposed ~50 km southwest of
Jezero Crater [@Quinn2019]. High-resolution terrain models
covering a wide area were critical to that work, leading to the discovery
of key geological features and relationships. Building integrated elevation data
products is thus a critical aspect of driving regional-scale science in the northeast
Syrtis Region and globally. -->

<h2>Jezero crater lake</h2>
<div data-location="jezero_w">
<p>Jezero is a ~40 km–diameter impact crater on the western margin of Isidis Basin. Perseverance will land just inside its western rim.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="jezero_delta">
<p>The centerpiece of Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited where a river entered a shallow lake filling the crater.<span class="citation" data-cites="Schon2012"><sup><a href="#ref-Schon2012" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> This impressive feature is the most charismatic surface expression of a long-lived regional drainage network. However, whether this and similar features are indicative of a global hydrosphere and “warm and wet” early Martian climate is hotly debated.<span class="citation" data-cites="Gaidos2003 Wordsworth2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Gaidos2003" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>,<a href="#ref-Wordsworth2015" role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div data-location="full_of_sediment">
<p>In addition to hosting a delta, Jezero is filled to the brim with sediment, likely at least 1 km thick. Reasonable timescales of deposition rate suggest that filling the entire crater took upwards of 1–10 Myr.<span class="citation" data-cites="Goudge2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Goudge2015" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span> Crater-counting studies on the resistant crater floor unit suggest that this sedimentary fill was deposited before 3.5–3.8 Gyr ago.<span class="citation" data-cites="Fassett2008 Goudge2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Goudge2015" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-Fassett2008" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="side-note">
<p>The sediments filling Jezero Crater present an interesting parallel to Gale Crater, where the Curiosity rover has been operating since 2012. Gale hosts a similar (although much thicker) sedimentary sequence, much of which has been excavated by wind erosion. Here, it remains buried and inaccessible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-location="outlet_channel">
<p>Jezero also has several different outlet channels, and changes in their geometry over time suggest a long-lived lacustrine system.<span class="citation" data-cites="Salese2020a Schon2012"><sup><a href="#ref-Schon2012" role="doc-biblioref">1</a>,<a href="#ref-Salese2020a" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> This feature has great paleoenvironmental importance — an “overfilled” lake with a throughgoing river system would potentially have a much more neutral water chemistry than a terminal evaporitic sump.</p>

<h2>Jezero fluvial system</h2>
<div data-location="jezero_delta_2">
<p>One of the most compelling features of the Jezero fluvial system is its extensive drainage system, which integrates sediment from a large area of the Martian highlands.</p>

<p>The river valley upstream of the Jezero delta continues eastward into the uplands surrounding Isidis Basin.</p>

<p>The upstream extension of the paleoriver that deposited sediment in Jezero Crater continues for over 200 km past the northern rim of Hargraves crater, and into the Nilosyrtis highlands.</p>

<p>With careful geochemical analysis and deconvolution,<span class="citation" data-cites="Siebach2017"><sup><a href="#ref-Siebach2017" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span> sediments within Jezero might provide a window into bedrock formation and alteration across a wide area.</p>

<h2>Northeast Syrtis</h2>
<div data-location="ne-syrtis-overview">
<p>Jezero crater sits in a well-studied and globally significant regional context. The stratigraphy of Northeast Syrtis contains rock units representing the first billion years of Mars history in close proximity. Jezero’s delta and lacustrine features seem to be related to the latter part of this history.</p>
<p>The stratigraphy, emplaced after the Isidis Basin-forming impact around 3.9 Ga,<span class="citation" data-cites="Mustard2009a"><sup><a href="#ref-Mustard2009a" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span> broadly consists of universal</p>
<p>record many globally-characteristic long-term evolutions in igneous mineralogy, hydrated mineral alteration products, and</p>
<p>basement alteration by a vigorous and long-lived groundwater system, followed by the accumulation and partial erosion of thick sedimentary sequences. All of this activity predates the most recent phase of Jezero’s fluvial system.</p>
