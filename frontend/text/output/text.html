<p>This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the <strong>Perseverance</strong> rover, currently <em>en route</em> to Mars after launching on July 30th, 2020. Jezero sits within northeast Syrtis Major, a region with a rich and multifaceted geological history.</p>
<p>If the Mars 2020 mission can employ direct observations of Jezero and its surroundings to answer questions posed by regional contextual studies, we will develop a much richer accounting of the history and fate of water (and <em>perhaps</em> life) on early Mars.</p>
<!-- Much of my PhD was dedicated to interpreting the geologic history of Syrtis Major,
particularly aspects involving the "layered sulfates" exposed ~50 km southwest of
Jezero Crater [@Quinn2019]. High-resolution terrain models
covering a wide area were critical to that work, leading to the discovery
of key geological features and relationships. Building integrated elevation data
products is thus a critical aspect of driving regional-scale science in the northeast
Syrtis Region and globally. -->

<h3>Upper stratigraphy</h3>
<div data-location="syrtis_major_edge">
<p>The upper stratigraphy of northeast Syrtis Major was emplaced between late Noachian and Amazonian time.

<h4>Thick, layered sediments</h4>
<div data-location="layered-sulfates">
<p>~40 km southwest of Jezero Crater, a sequence of sulfate-bearing sedimentary rocks up to 450 m thick sits unconformably above the eroded basement units.

<div class="side-note">
<p>Much of my PhD was devoted to studying the layered sulfates and their position within the upper stratigraphy of northeast Syrtis Major. <span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></span> reports many of the units and relationships described below. Most of these discoveries relied were driven by the basic physical relationships exhibited in this viewer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-location="smooth-capping-surface">
<p>The layered sulfates have been substantially eroded, and are preserved only in mesas capped by a more erosionally resistant unit. In some places, the layered sulfates occur beneath the Syrtis Major lavas, but much of the unit is instead topped by an enigmatic “smooth capping unit.” This ~5-20 m thick cap is significantly smoother than the lava flows, occurs at higher elevation, and retains craters poorly.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> Its origin is currently unknown.</p>
</div>
<div data-location="boxwork-fractures-area">
<p>One of the more striking features of the layered sulfates are “boxwork” ridges that cover large portions of the unit. These ridges show spectral signatures of jarosite, an iron sulfate mineral indicative of acidic waters (on Earth, it is usually associated with ore deposits). They were originally formed as fractures and later channelized sulfate-bearing fluids.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span></p>
<p>These ridges are often arcuate, have no preferred orientation, and penetrate the entire thickness of the layered sulfates where exposed. They are similar in geometry and scale to “polygonal faults” found in terrestrial submarine sediments; these form due to compaction and dewatering after deposition.<span class="citation" data-cites="Cartwright2011 Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a>,<a href="#ref-Cartwright2011" role="doc-biblioref">20</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div data-location="sulfate-overview">
Together, the draping depositional style of the layered sulfates and the volume-loss fractures they host suggest that these sediments were deposited in a submarine setting. This is a fairly surprising finding, strongly suggesting the presence of a global ocean on Mars during Noachian time.<span class="citation" data-cites="Quinn2019"><sup><a href="#ref-Quinn2019" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> Alternatively, a proposed ice sheet in Isidis Basin<span class="citation" data-cites="Soucek2015"><sup><a href="#ref-Soucek2015" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span> could conceivably provide periglacial lacustrine environments for deposition of thick sedimentary sequences.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<div data-location="syrtis-overview-2">
<p>The northeast Syrtis Major stratigraphy records a phase of intense bedrock alteration in a vigorous subsurface water system. A thick sedimentary sequence above this was likely emplaced by underwater deposition followed by progressive erosion and capping by both lavas and thin, enigmatic capping units. The last substantial stage of erosion carved small channels and built deltas and shallow lake deposits within localized basins. These lake deposits are often close in elevation and similar form to the Jezero deposits, suggesting that they may be products of the same system.</p>
<p>As the Perseverance mission progresses, it will be critical to engage with the richness of this regional context, particularly the implications for a multiphase history of abundant water, both in the subsurface and as surface bodies of water. Much of this history likely predates the surface features expressed in Jezero crater, but the records of these phases will have been preserved in fluvial sediments; the challenge is unmixing them!</p>
<p>This long history also emphasizes the importance of the rover’s planned extended mission out of Jezero Crater and south towards the proposed “Midway” landing site. This will allow the rover to see many northeast Syrtis Major units <em>in situ</em>, which will provide an incredible wealth of information about the groundwater system of early Mars.</p>

<p>This viewer interface is an adaptation of a digital globe renderer currently under construction for the <a href="https://macrostrat.org">Macrostrat</a> composite geologic map interface. Here, the code is adapted for Mars; critically, it integrates topography data products (especially, a multistrip CTX elevation model) that extend medium-resolution elevation maps over a large area. These context-scale regional products are difficult to generate using current tooling, but are important basic precursors for any study emphasizing regional geologic context.</p>
<p>The potential for 3D visualization in the geosciences is evolving rapidly; the field can benefit from a growing ecosystem of impressive Earth observation software.
