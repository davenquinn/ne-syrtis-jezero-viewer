- The ability to view topography in 3D is essential

At Macrostrat, we are building multi-scale global geologic maps
integrating data from worldwide sources.

# Todos

## Viewer

- Integrate some sort of keyframe system for smoother and more controllable
  animations
- Provide more controls on data layers, etc. (components of existing projects
  based on CesiumJS such as [TerriaJS](https://terria.io/) can be adapted here).
- Terrain pre-processing blocks the main browser rendering thread, resulting in
  major display lag during view transitions.
