This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the **Perseverance** rover, currently
_en route_ to Mars after launching on July 30th, 2020. Jezero sits within
northeast Syrtis Major, a region with a rich and multifaceted geological
history.

If the Mars 2020 mission can effectively use its direct observations of Jezero
and its surroundings
to answer questions posed by regional contextual studies, we will develop
a much richer accounting of
the history and fate of water (and _perhaps_ life) on early Mars.

<!-- Much of my PhD was dedicated to interpreting the geologic history of Syrtis Major,
particularly aspects involving the "layered sulfates" exposed ~50 km southwest of
Jezero Crater [@Quinn2019]. High-resolution terrain models
covering a wide area were critical to that work, leading to the discovery
of key geological features and relationships. Building integrated elevation data
products is thus a critical aspect of driving regional-scale science in the northeast
Syrtis Region and globally. -->

## Jezero crater lake

<div data-location="jezero_w">

Jezero is a ~40 km–diameter impact crater on the western margin of Isidis Basin.
Perseverance will land just inside its western rim.

</div>

<div data-location="jezero_delta">

The centerpiece of Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited where a river
entered a shallow lake filling the crater [@Schon2012]. This impressive feature
is the most charismatic surface expression of a long-lived regional drainage network.
However, whether this and similar features are indicative of a global hydrosphere
and "warm and wet" early Martian climate is hotly
debated [e.g. @Gaidos2003; @Wordsworth2015].

</div>

<div data-location="full_of_sediment">

In addition to hosting a delta, Jezero is filled to the brim with sediment,
likely at least 1 km thick. Reasonable timescales of deposition rate suggest
that filling the entire crater took upwards of 1–10 Myr [@Goudge2015].
Crater-counting studies on the resistant crater floor unit suggest
that this sedimentary fill was deposited before 3.5–3.8 Gyr ago
[@Fassett2008; @Goudge2015].

<div class="side-note">
The sediments filling Jezero Crater present an
interesting parallel to Gale Crater, where the Curiosity rover has been
operating since 2012. Gale hosts a similar (although much thicker) sedimentary
sequence, much of which has been excavated by wind erosion. Here, it remains
buried and inaccessible.
</div>

</div>

<div data-location="outlet_channel"> Jezero also has several different outlet
channels, and changes in their geometry over time suggest a long-lived
lacustrine system [@Salese2020a; @Schon2012]. This feature has great
paleoenvironmental importance — an "overfilled" lake with a throughgoing river
system would potentially have a much more neutral water chemistry than a
terminal evaporitic sump.

</div>

## Jezero fluvial system

<div data-location="jezero_delta_2">
One of the most compelling features of the Jezero fluvial system is its extensive
drainage system, which integrates sediment from a large area of the Martian highlands.
</div>

<div data-location="river_nili_fossae">
The river valley upstream of the Jezero delta
continues eastward into the uplands surrounding Isidis Basin.
</div>

<div data-location="river_nili_fossae_detail">

It cuts across the Nili Fossae ring graben system, concentric valleys formed shortly
after the Isidis Basin–forming impact.

</div>

<div data-location="river_nilosyrtis">

The upstream extension of the paleoriver that deposited sediment in Jezero Crater
continues for over 200 km past the northern rim of Hargraves crater,
and into the Nilosyrtis highlands.

</div>

With careful geochemical analysis and deconvolution [e.g. @Siebach2017],
sediments within Jezero might provide a window into bedrock formation and
alteration across a wide area.

## Northeast Syrtis

<div data-location="ne-syrtis-overview">

Jezero crater sits in a well-studied and globally significant regional context.
The stratigraphy of Northeast Syrtis contains rock units representing
the first billion years of Mars history in close proximity. Jezero's delta and
lacustrine features seem to be related to the latter part of this history.

The stratigraphy, emplaced after the Isidis Basin-forming impact around 3.9 Ga
[e.g. @Mustard2009a], broadly consists of universal

record many globally-characteristic long-term evolutions in
igneous mineralogy, hydrated mineral alteration products, and

basement alteration by a vigorous and long-lived groundwater system, followed
by the accumulation and partial erosion of thick sedimentary sequences. All
of this activity predates the most recent phase of Jezero's fluvial system.

</div>

<div data-location="syrtis_major_edge">

The edge of the Syrtis Major lavas

</div>

@Scheller2020 reports lots of interesting structure

Linear ridges suggest voluminous subsurface water flow during the early
Noachian e.g. @Pascuzzo2019.

<div data-location="layered-sulfates">

The layered sulfates are sediments on top of this stuff.
They are capped by an enigmatic capping unit that was originally mapped as
part of the Syrtis Major lava flows. However, recent mapping work

</div>
