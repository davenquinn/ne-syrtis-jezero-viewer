This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the **Perseverance** rover,
currently *en route* to Mars after launching on July 30th, 2020. Jezero is
a great landing site, in a region with a rich and multifaceted
geological history. Part of the challenge of the Mars 2020 mission will be to
reconstruct this sequence with access to only a part of it.

</div>

<div data-location="jezero_w">

Jezero is a ~40 km–diameter impact crater on the western margin of Isidis Basin.
Perseverance will land just inside its western rim.

</div>



<div data-location="jezero_delta">

The centerpiece of Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited where a river
entered a shallow lake filling the crater [@Schon2012]. This impressive feature
is the most charismatic surface expression of a long-lived regional drainage network.
However, whether this and similar features are indicative of a global hydrosphere
and "warm and wet" early Martian climate is hotly
debated [e.g. @Gaidos2003; @Wordsworth2015].

</div>

<div data-location="full_of_sediment">

Understanding the significance of
In addition to hosting a delta, Jezero
is filled to the brim with sediment.
Reasonable timescales of deposition suggest that filling the entire crater
with sediment took upwards of 1–10 Myr [@Goudge2015].
Crater-counting studies on the resistant crater floor unit suggest a minimum
age of ~3.8-3.5 Ga for this sedimentary fill [@Fassett2008; @Goudge2015].

<div class="side-note">
The sedimentary fill presents an interesting parallel to Gale Crater, where the Curiosity rover has been operating since 2012. Gale hosts a
similar (although much thicker) sedimentary sequence, of which much has been
excavated by wind erosion. Here, it remains buried and inaccessible.
</div>

<div data-location="outlet_channel">
Jezero also has an outlet channel, apparent changes over time in its geometry
suggest a long-lived lacustrine system [@Salese2020a; @Schon2012].
</div>

<div data-location="jezero_delta_2">
One of the most interesting aspects of Jezero is the extent of its river system
and *source* of the sediments stored there.
</div>


<div data-location="jezero_upriver">
*Neretva Valles*, the river valley that eventually leads to the Jezero delta,
continues eastward into the uplands surrounding Isidis Basin.
</div>


<div data-location="river_nili_fossae">

It cuts across the Nili Fossae ring graben system, concentric valleys formed shortly
after the Isidis Basin–forming impact.

</div>

<div data-location="river_nilosyrtis">

...and continues for over 200 km past the northern rim of Hargraves crater,
and into the Nilosyrtis highlands.

</div>


The northeast Syrtis region is also fascinating.



@Scheller2020 reports lots of interesting structure


Linear ridges suggest voluminous subsurface water flow during the early
Noachian e.g. @Pascuzzo2019.
