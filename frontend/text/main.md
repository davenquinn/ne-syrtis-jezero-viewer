Welcome to Jezero Crater, the landing site of the Mars 2020 **Perseverance** rover,
currently *en route* to Mars.

The star of the show in Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited as an
ancient river entered a shallow lake, dumping its sediment.

Crater-counting studies suggest an
age of ~3.8-3.5 Ga for fluvial activity in the basin [@Fassett2008; @Goudge2015].
Reasonable timescales of deposition suggest that filling the entire crater
with sediment took upwards of 1–10 Myr [@Goudge2015].

The northeast Syrtis region is also fascinating.

@Scheller2020 reports lots of interesting structure


Linear ridges suggest voluminous subsurface water flow during the early
Noachian e.g. @Pascuzzo2019.
