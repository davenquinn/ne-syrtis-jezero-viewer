<div data-location="initial">

This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the **Perseverance** rover, currently
_en route_ to Mars after launching on July 30th, 2020. Jezero sits within
northeast Syrtis Major, a region with a rich and multifaceted geological
history.

If the Mars 2020 mission can employ direct observations of Jezero
and its surroundings to answer questions posed by regional contextual studies,
we will develop a much richer accounting of the history and fate of water (and
_perhaps_ life) on early Mars.

</div>

## The Jezero crater lake

<div data-location="jezero_w">

Jezero is a ~40 km–diameter impact crater on the western margin of Isidis Basin.
Perseverance will land just inside its western rim.

</div>

<div data-location="jezero_delta">

The centerpiece of Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited where a river
entered a shallow lake filling the crater [@Schon2012]. This impressive feature
is the most charismatic surface expression of a long-lived regional drainage network.
However, whether this and similar features are indicative of a global hydrosphere
and "warm and wet" early Martian climate is hotly
debated [e.g. @Gaidos2003; @Wordsworth2015].

</div>

<div data-location="full-of-sediment">

In addition to hosting a delta, Jezero is filled to the brim with sediment,
likely at least 1 km thick. Reasonable rates of deposition suggest
that filling the entire crater took upwards of 1–10 Myr [@Goudge2015].
Crater-counting studies on the resistant crater floor unit suggest
that this sedimentary fill was deposited before 3.5–3.8 Gyr ago
[@Fassett2008; @Goudge2015].

<div class="side-note">
The sediments filling Jezero Crater present an
interesting parallel to Gale Crater, where the Curiosity rover has been
operating since 2012. Gale hosts a similar (although much thicker) sedimentary
sequence, much of which has been excavated by wind erosion. Here, it remains
buried and inaccessible.
</div>

</div>

<div data-location="outlet_channel"> Jezero also has several different outlet
channels, and changes in their geometry over time suggest a long-lived
lacustrine system [@Salese2020a; @Schon2012]. This feature has great
paleoenvironmental importance — an "overfilled" lake with a throughgoing river
system would potentially have a much more neutral water chemistry than a
terminal evaporitic sump.

</div>

## The Jezero upstream fluvial system

<div data-location="jezero_delta_2">
One of the most compelling features of Jezero is the extensive
drainage system that feeds into the crater. This system
captures sediment from a large area of the Martian highlands.
</div>

<div data-location="river_nili_fossae">
The river valley upstream of the Jezero delta
continues eastward into the uplands surrounding Isidis Basin.
</div>

<div data-location="river_nili_fossae_detail">

It cuts across the Nili Fossae ring graben system, concentric valleys formed shortly
after the Isidis Basin–forming impact.

</div>

<div data-location="river_nilosyrtis">

The upstream extension of the paleoriver that deposited sediment in Jezero Crater
continues for over 200 km past the northern rim of Hargraves crater,
and into the Nilosyrtis highlands.

With careful geochemical analysis and deconvolution [e.g. @Siebach2017],
sediments within Jezero might provide a window into bedrock formation and
alteration across a wide area.

</div>

## Northeast Syrtis Major

<div data-location="ne-syrtis-overview">

Jezero crater sits in a well-studied and globally significant regional context.
The stratigraphy of Northeast Syrtis contains rock units representing
the first billion years of Mars history in close proximity. Jezero's delta and
lacustrine features seem to be related to the latter part of this history.

The stratigraphy, emplaced after the Isidis Basin-forming impact around 3.9 Gyr
ago [e.g. @Mustard2009a], broadly consists of megabreccia and ultramafic igneous
rocks altered by a vigorous and long-lived groundwater system [@Pascuzzo2019;
@Scheller2020; @Bramble2017], topped by thick, partially eroded "layered sulfate" sediments.
The stratigraphy was capped at ~3.4-3.6 Gyr ago by Syrtis Major lavas. The
partial erosion of these capping lavas by other fluvial systems in the region
strongly suggest that the latest phase of Jezero's river system occurred in late
Hesperian or Amazonian time [@Quinn2019].

</div>

### Basement and igneous units

<div data-location="ne-syrtis-plains">

<!--
The first hint of the superlative nature of the northeast Syrtis stratigraphy
came from the OMEGA (on ESA's _Mars Express_) and CRISM (on NASA's _Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter_) imaging spectrometers. This northeast Syrtis
-->

The centerpiece of northeast Syrtis is its beveled peneplain, a flattened
erosional surface exposing highly altered bedrock. This region hosts the an
olivine-bearing ultramafic rock that has been highly altered to carbonates (the
first detection of carbonate rocks found on Mars) [@Ehlmann2008a]. A range of
hydrated Fe/Mg smectite clay alteration products were also detected
[@Mustard2007; @Ehlmann2009]. Many of these alteration products are detectable
in the Jezero delta deposit, suggesting that altered upland bedrock was
transported and redeposited within Jezero [@Ehlmann2008b]. The range of
alteration mineralogy displayed at northeast Syrtis (first clays, then
carbonates, then sulfates, and finally a relative lack of alteration) are
indicative of major transitions in the surface and subsurface hydrosphere of
early Mars [@Ehlmann2012].

<div class="side-note">
CRISM summary products showing hyperspectral detections will be integrated into
a later version of this viewer.
</div>

</div>

<div data-location="basement-fractures">

The Syrtis Major basement is pervasively fractured; these fractures
were mediated by the geodynamic stresses of the Isidis Basin and formed conduits
channelizing fluid flow and alteration, which was widespread and intense
during Noachian time [@Saper2013; @Pascuzzo2019].

</div>

<div data-location="basement-megabreccia">

The basement also contains megabreccia blocks, many of which are visible from
orbit [@Bramble2017]. Many of these were brought up from the mantle by the
Isidis impact, while other internally stratified blocks originate from the
mid-crust [@Scheller2020].

<div class="side-note">
These megabreccia blocks can be better seen using higher-resolution HiRISE imagery,
which will be integrated into a later version of this viewer.
</div>

</div>

### Upper stratigraphy

<div data-location="syrtis_major_edge">

The upper stratigraphy of northeast Syrtis Major was emplaced between late
Noachian and Amazonian time. Broadly, it consists of layered sulfate-bearing
sediments capped by early Hesperian Syrtis Major lava flows. The lava
flows and underlying sulfates were then eroded by river channels; adjacent
basins are filled with lake sediments [@Skok2014LPSC; @Quinn2019]. The size and
base level of these sedimentary deposits suggest that they were formed at the
same time as the Jezero delta and latest phase of its fluvial system.

</div>

<div data-location="inner-ring-mountains">

The upper stratigraphy units embay isolated summits with up to 1500 m prominence,
which may be remnants of an eroded inner ring of Isidis Basin.

</div>

#### Thick, layered sediments

<div data-location="layered-sulfates">

~40 km southwest of Jezero Crater, a sequence of sulfate-bearing sedimentary
rocks up to 450 m thick sits unconformably above the eroded basement units. The
sediments drape the underlying basement units and are not flat-lying, suggesting
deposition by settling rather than traction currents [@Quinn2019]. Although
these rocks have been called the "layered sulfates" in the literature, they are
likely sulfate-cemented, clastic sedimentary rocks.

<div class="side-note">
Much of my PhD was devoted to studying the layered sulfates and their position
within the upper stratigraphy of northeast Syrtis Major. @Quinn2019 reports many
of the units and relationships described below. Most of these discoveries relied
were driven by the basic physical relationships exhibited in this viewer.
</div>

</div>

<div data-location="smooth-capping-surface">

The layered sulfates have been substantially eroded, and are preserved only in
mesas capped by a more erosionally resistant unit.
In some places, the layered sulfates occur beneath the Syrtis Major lavas, but
much of the unit is instead topped by an enigmatic "smooth capping unit." This
~5-20 m thick cap is significantly smoother than the lava flows, occurs at higher
elevation, and retains craters poorly [@Quinn2019]. Its origin is currently unknown.

</div>

<div data-location="boxwork-fractures-area">

One of the more striking features of the layered sulfates are "boxwork"
ridges that cover large portions of the unit. These ridges show spectral
signatures of jarosite, an iron sulfate mineral indicative of
acidic waters (on Earth, it is usually associated with ore deposits). They were
originally formed as fractures and later channelized sulfate-bearing fluids [@Quinn2019].

These ridges are often arcuate, have no preferred orientation, and penetrate
the entire thickness of the layered sulfates where exposed. They are similar in
geometry and scale to "polygonal faults" found in terrestrial submarine sediments;
these form due to compaction and dewatering after deposition [@Cartwright2011; @Quinn2019].

</div>

<div data-location="sulfate-overview">

Together, the draping depositional style of the layered sulfates and the
volume-loss fractures they host suggest that these sediments were deposited in a
submarine setting. This is a fairly surprising finding, strongly suggesting
the presence of a global ocean on Mars during Noachian time [@Quinn2019].
Alternatively, a proposed ice sheet in Isidis Basin [@Soucek2015] could
conceivably provide periglacial lacustrine environments for deposition of thick
sedimentary sequences. </div>

#### Syrtis Major lava flows

<div data-location="syrtis-major-inverted">

The Syrtis Major lava flows (the edge of a 900 km wide, low-relief shield)
flowed eastward into the study area during late Hesperian time [@Hiesinger2004].
These flows appear to have been channelized in a paleovalley and are now
"inverted", with the surrounding confining material stripped away. This
relationship suggests that sulfate-bearing sediments were once much more
widespread in the northeast Syrtis region than their current extent
[@Quinn2019].

</div>

#### Fluvial channels and lake deposits

<div data-location="fluvial-channels">

Fluvial channels are cut down through the Syrtis Major lava flows, sulfates, and
underlying basement rocks. These channels are associated with channel features
on top of the Syrtis Major lava flows [@Mangold2008].

</div>

<div data-location="delta-2">

This generation of fluvial activity, which cuts across much of the upper northeast
Syrtis stratigraphy, also includes its own delta deposits!

</div>

<div data-location="paleovalley">

In some locations, paleovalley relationships are preserved that show the relative
timing of all the phases affecting the northeast Syrtis upper stratigraphy.
Here, the Syrtis Major lava flows are channelized
between hillslopes of layered sulfates. Later erosion is focused at the flow
boundaries on both sides of the valley.

</div>

## Summary

### A multistage history of subsurface and surface water

<div data-location="syrtis-overview-2">

The northeast Syrtis Major stratigraphy records a phase of intense bedrock
alteration in a vigorous subsurface water system. A thick sedimentary sequence
above this was likely emplaced by underwater deposition followed by progressive
erosion and capping by both lavas and thin, enigmatic capping units. The last
substantial stage of erosion carved small channels and built deltas and shallow
lake deposits within localized basins. These lake deposits are often close in
elevation and similar form to the Jezero deposits, suggesting formation in
the same system.

As the Perseverance mission progresses, it will be critical to situate the
rover's findings in this multiphase history of subsurface and surface hydrology.
The breadth of the system also underscores the importance of the rover's planned extended
mission out of Jezero Crater and south towards the proposed "Midway" landing
site. This will allow the rover to see many northeast Syrtis Major units _in situ_,
which will provide an incredible wealth of information about the groundwater system
of early Mars.

### The importance of 3D visualization and regional data products

<div data-location="viewer-guts">

[This viewer interface](/about) is an adaptation of a
digital globe renderer currently under construction for the
[Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org) composite geologic map interface. Here, the
code is adapted for Mars; most critically, it integrates topography data products
(especially, a multistrip CTX elevation model) that extend medium-resolution
elevation maps over a large area. These context-scale regional products are
difficult to generate using current tooling, but are important basic precursors
for any study emphasizing regional geologic context.

The potential for 3D visualization in the geosciences is evolving rapidly; the
field can benefit from a growing ecosystem of impressive Earth observation
software. The Mars science community must prioritize the generation of wide-area
composite products that can unlock the potential of these new media and drive
assessment of geologic context.
