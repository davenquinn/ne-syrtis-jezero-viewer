This is Jezero Crater, the landing site of the Mars 2020 **Perseverance** rover,
currently *en route* to Mars.

<div data-location="jezero_w">

Perseverance will land just inside the western edge of Jezero Crater, a ~40 km
diameter impact crater on the wester margin of Isidis Basin.

<div data-location="jezero_delta">

The centerpiece of Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited as an
ancient river entered a shallow lake [@Schon2012]. This impressive feature
is the most charismatic surface expression of a long-lived regional drainage network.

</div>

<div data-location="full_of_sediment">

In addition to hosting sedimentary features diagnostic of an ancient lake, Jezero
is filled to the brim with sediment!
Reasonable timescales of deposition suggest that filling the entire crater
with sediment took upwards of 1â€“10 Myr [@Goudge2015].
Crater-counting studies on the resistant crater floor unit suggest a minimum
age of ~3.8-3.5 Ga for this sedimentary fill [@Fassett2008; @Goudge2015].

The sedimentary fill presents an interesting parallel to Gale Crater, where the Curiosity rover has been operating since 2012. Gale hosts a
similar (although much thicker) sedimentary sequence.
In Gale, significant wind erosion has brought much of this sedimentary stack
to the surface, but here it remains buried an inaccessible.

<div data-location="outlet_channel">
Jezero also has an outlet channel that may
have been carved in stages, suggesting a long-lived lacustrine system
[@Salese2020a; @Schon2012].
</div>


<div data-location="jezero_upriver">
The Jezero river channel continues eastward into the uplands surrounding Isidis Basin.
</div>


<div data-location="river_nili_fossae">

It cuts across the Nili Fossae ring graben system...

</div>

<div data-location="river_nilosyrtis">

...and continues for over 200 km into the Nilosyrtis highlands.

</div>


The northeast Syrtis region is also fascinating.



@Scheller2020 reports lots of interesting structure


Linear ridges suggest voluminous subsurface water flow during the early
Noachian e.g. @Pascuzzo2019.
