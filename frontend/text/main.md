The star of the show in Jezero Crater is its delta, deposited as an
ancient river entered a shallow lake, dumping its sediment.

Reasonable timescales of deposition suggest that filling the entire crater
with sediment took upwards of 1–10 Myr [@Goudge2015].

The northeast Syrtis region is also fascinating.

@Scheller2020 reports lots of interesting structure


Linear ridges suggest voluminous subsurface water flow during the early
Noachian e.g. @Pascuzzo2019.
